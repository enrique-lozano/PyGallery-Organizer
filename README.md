# PyGallery Toolkit üìÇüñºÔ∏è‚Äã‚Äã

A set of tools to fix the metadata of your images and videos, find and remove similar images, and organize your folder structure to create a well-structured gallery. All this with simple scripts!

## Download/Installation steps üöÄ

To install the project you must have python 3 installed and added to your path. Once this step is done, you should clone/download this project and run this command in a terminal, in the directory where you have cloned the project:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Notes:**

> The project has been made with python version 3.11, so its compatibility with later or previous versions is not guaranteed. Also, has been only tested in a Windows machine, so it is also not guaranteed that the results will be optimal in other systems (please, open an issue if that is the case).

## Usage example üí°

If the installation was successful, you are ready to start! To do it, you will have to run the functionality that you want in the following way:

```
python script.py your_path_to_the_assets --arg1 --arg2 ...
```

Here you will have to replace `script.py` for the script that you want.
