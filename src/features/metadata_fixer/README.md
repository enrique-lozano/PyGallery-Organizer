# Metadata fixer üìÇ

Fix common problems with your files by adding missing date metadata and other tags.

## Description üìù

Metadata is additional information embedded within the file that describes its attributes. For images, this may include details such as the date the photo was taken, the camera settings used, and even location information. Videos also contain metadata like duration, resolution, and creation date.

On many occasions, especially when the photos and videos come from external media such as the Internet or social networks such as WhatsApp, the metadata is very lacking in information or directly incorrect. This means that when using these images and videos on other platforms that use these metadata (such as Google Photos) you may see incorrect information.

The metadata_fixer.py script helps you address common issues with the metadata of your image and video files, such as missing date metadata. It can add missing dates based on various sources, fix GPS coordinates, and modify file creation and modification times based on existing metadata.

## Usage üí°

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python metadata_fixer.py input_path --arg1 --arg2 ...
```

### Arguments

- **input_path (required)**: Absolute path to the images to process.

- **--dates_from**: Sources to obtain the capture date of the asset, in order of preference. Options can include 'fileexif' (from file's EXIF data), 'filename' (from the filename) or 'filedate' (from the OS date of the file). Default is `["fileexif", "filename"]`.

- **--overwrite_dates**: Overwrite existing date tags based on the `--dates_from` argument, even if they are already defined.

- **--gps_fix**: Fix the `QuickTime` tag of the file metadata.

- **--os_dates**: Modify the file creation and modification time based on its EXIF data.

- **--recursive**: Whether we should search for files in subdirectories of the input directory. Default is True.

- **-v, --verbose**: Enable verbose output.

## Important notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Make sure the `input_path` and the `output_path` are absolute paths.
- Use caution when adjusting `hash_size` and `similarity` to balance accuracy and performance.

## Examples üõ†Ô∏è

### Basic Example

Remove duplicate or similar images from the "C:/users/your_user/images" directory:

```
python duplicates_remover.py "C:/users/your_user/images"
```

### Adjusting Hash Size and Similarity

Use a larger hash size and stricter similarity threshold:

```
python duplicates_remover.py "C:/users/your_user/images" --hash_size 32 --similarity 98
```

### Disable Image Display

Remove duplicates without displaying images for confirmation:

```
python duplicates_remover.py "C:/users/your_user/images" --similarity 96 --plot_disabled
```

### Verbose Output

Use the `--verbose` fag anywhere to enable an output with more detailed logs:

```
python duplicates_remover.py "C:/users/your_user/images" --similarity 96 --verbose
```
